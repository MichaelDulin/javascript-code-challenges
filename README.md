# javascript-code-challenges


## Goal ##
The goal of this file is to provide some slightly more basic code challenges to help solidify fundamentals. Other code challenges either move to fast or fail to reinforce some key principles. The idea of these challenges is taking some fundementals of coding, starting simple and building into more complex operations. As the user is slowly given more challenging problems, they should be able to identify key parts of said problem in order to break it down into more understandable code, which is similar to previous challenges. 


## Testing ##
A test suite is provided for each challenge set. To test:

1. Fork this repository
2. Open terminal and run:   npm i
3. In terminal, run:        npm test


## Note ##
Let me know if there are any specific challenges you would like to work on and I will implement them. I will contiuously add to this when I have the time. 

Please do not change any test files.
If there are any errors please reach out to me.
